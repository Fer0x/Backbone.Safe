{"tagline":"A plugin for backbone models to save & load data using localstorage as well","body":"# Backbone.Safe - local storage plugin\r\nBackbone.Safe is a plugin for Backbone.js which stores a model's or a collection's json data to the local storage on set operations, regardless server side existance.\r\n\r\n## Latest Features\r\nBackbone.Safe is now in version 2 - this version define 'Safe' as a first level backbone plugin.\r\nYou can define safe as a key in a Backbone's Object props.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar HistoryPlaylist = Backbone.Collection.extend({\r\n\tmodel: someModel,\r\n\r\n\tsafe: 'historyPlaylist',\r\n\r\n// or - define it as such (both are equivalent):\r\n\tsafe: {\r\n\t\tkey: 'historyPlaylist',\r\n\t\toptions: {\r\n\t\t\treload: true\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\r\n\tqueue: function(youtubeJSON) {\r\n\t\tthis.add(youtubeJSON);\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\nvar myPlaylist = new HistoryPlaylist();\r\n\r\nconsole.log( myPlaylist.safe );\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nYou can still create Backbone.Safe on demand as such:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar HistoryPlaylist = Backbone.Collection.extend({\r\n\tmodel: someModel,\r\n\r\n\tinitialize: function() {\r\n\t\tBackbone.Safe.create('historyPlaylist', this);\r\n\t},\r\n\r\n\tqueue: function(youtubeJSON) {\r\n\t\tthis.add(youtubeJSON);\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\nvar myPlaylist = new HistoryPlaylist();\r\n\r\nconsole.log( myPlaylist.safe );\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Useful Information\r\n1. Currently supports only one level of models/collections.\r\n2. For Model: listens to a 'change' events and stores the data.\r\n3. For Collection: listens to 'add', 'reset' events and stores data.\r\n4. The 'create' function creates a new instance of Backbone.Safe in the 'safe' property\r\n5. Currently, the 'options' property has only one options - 'reload': true (as a default) - it reloads the data that is stored in the cache after a refresh or on recreation.\r\n\r\nDownload: [Backbone.Safe](https://github.com/orizens/Backbone.Safe/zipball/master)\r\n\r\nBy [Oren Farhi](http://orizens.com)","note":"Don't delete this file!
